\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


Overall, the objectives defined for this laboratory were successfully met.

We were able to improve the circuit managing the coupling capacitor to extend the bandwidth, managing the bypass capacitor to reduce the loss of gain on the resistor R_E and improve the gain using resistor R_C.


Our goal was to achieve an equilibrium between the quality of the output signal , so it doesn't have the visible distortion of the input sines waves , and the cost of all the components. We obtained a merit of 1186.634.

The simulation analysis, using ngspice, gave us more precise results than the theoretical analysis using Octave, as was to be expected. This is because not only the ngspice uses more complex transistor models but also due to the approximations that were made in the theoretical analysis. For example, we considered that the capacitors behaved as short-circuits, meaning we had cutoff frequencies $f_{low}=0$ and $f_{high}= \infty$. This gave us a constant frequency response for the gain when actually this gain is only obtained in a limited interval of frequencies.  In several calculations we also approximated parallels of resistances to just the smallest of them all, which also slightly changes the results.

Comparing the results obtained in the simulation and theoretical analysis, the maximum gain obtained on ngspice was 40.08315 dB, while the gain obtained on Octave was 50.220 dB. This diference occurs due to the less sensitive model used on Octave which results in an overrated value of gain. 

The input impedance calculated by ngspice was 498.0704 $\Omega$ while, on the other hand, the theoretical value  given by Octave was 31979.45 $\Omega$. These values differ by two orders of magnitude. The output impedances calculated respectively by ngspice and Octave were 7.932271 and 0.80367 $\Omega$. Both these values are compatible with a 8 $\Omega$ load.
