\subsection{DC analysis}
Using the theoretical DC model, and keeping in mind that the input voltage has a DC component of $0V$ and that capacitors behave like open circuits for very low frequencies, the operating point was computed.


\subsubsection{Gain stage}
Replacing resistors $R_{B1}$ and $R_{B2}$, which are in parallel, with an equivalent resistor $R_{B}$, we have
\begin{equation}
R_B = \frac{R_{B1} R_{B2}}{R_{B1}+R_{B2}}
\end{equation}

Looking at the circuit as a voltage divider, we have
\begin{equation}
V_{eq} = \frac{R_{B2}}{R_{B1}+R_{B2}} V_{cc}
\end{equation}

Using the mesh analysis for the mesh on the left side and assuming that the current is going clockwise,


Since $I_{E1} = (1 + \beta_{FN}) I_{B1}$, that is equal to 


Through mesh analysis, and keeping in mind the relations between transistor currents, it is possible to determine $R_B$, $V_{eq}$, $I_{B1}$, $I_{C1}$, $I_{E1}$, $V_{O1}$, $V_{E1}$ and $V_{CE1}$ (all the currents and voltages in the circuit), where $I_{B1}$ and $I_{C1}$ are the current flowing into the base and collector of the first transistor, respectively, and $I_{E1}$ is the current flowing out of the emitter of the first transistor.

\subsubsection{Output stage}
Knowing that $V_{I2}=V_{O1}$ (the input of the output stage is the output of the gain stage), one can apply mesh analysis to the output stage and calculate $I_{E2}$, $I_{C2}$, $V_{O2}$ and $V_{I2}$.

\subsection{AC analysis}
The gain, input and output impedances were computed for each of the stages separately.

\subsubsection{Gain stage}
The gain, input impedance and output impedance of the gain stage are given by the following equations derived in the theoretical classes:
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
%Gain_1 = R_{C1} \times \frac{R_{E1}-g_{m1} \times r_{\pi 1} \times r_{o1}}{(r_{o1}+R_{C1}+R_{E1})\times(R_B+r_{\pi 1}+R_{E1})+g_{m1} \times R_{E1} \times r_{o1} \times r_{\pi 1} - R_{E1}^2} \\
%AV1= RC1*(RE1-gm1*rpi1*ro1)/((ro1+RC1+RE1)*(RB+rpi1+RE1)+gm1*RE1*ro1*rpi1 - RE1^2)
%AV1simple = gm1*RC1/(1+gm1*RE1)						       
%AV1simple2 = gm1*RC1/(1+gm1*RE1) * rpi1/ (RS + rpi1)
Gain_1 = -g_{m1} \times (R_{C1} || R_{o}) \times \frac{r_{\pi1} || R_{B1} || R_{B2}}{R_S+r_{\pi1} || R_{B1} || R_{B2}}\\
Z_{I1} = \frac{(r_{o1}+R_{C1}+R_{E1}) \times (R_B+r_{\pi 1}+R_{E1}) + g_{m1} \times R_{E1} \times r_{o1} \times r_{\pi 1} - R_{E1}^2}{r_{o1} + R_{C1} + R_{E1}} \\
Z_{O1} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{Z_X}+\frac{1}{R_{C1}}} \\
Z_X = r_{o1} \times (R_B+r_{\pi 1}) \times \frac{R_{E1}}{R_B+r_{\pi 1}+R_{E1}} \times (\frac{1}{r_{o1}}+\frac{1}{r_{\pi 1}+R_B}+\frac{1}{R_{E1}}+  \frac{g_{m1} r_{\pi 1}}{r_{\pi 1}+R_B}) \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where we used the gain expression with a bypass capacitor, which assumes that $R_{E1} = 0$, since for sufficiently high frequencies (namely the ones at which the gain is maximum) the capacitor behaves approximately like a short circuit, which is equivalent to $R_{E1}$ being a short-circuit since they are in parallel. Also note that $g_{m1}=\frac{I_{C1}}{V_T}$, $r_{\pi 1}=\frac{\beta_{FN}}{g_{m1}}$, $r_{o1}=\frac{V_A}{I_{C1}}$.

Furthermore, since $R_{B1}, R_{B2} \ll r_{\pi1}$ and $r_{o1} \ll R_C$, we have that the equivalent resistance for the parallel of resistors $R_{B1} || R_{B2} || r_{\pi1}$ and $r_{o1} || R_C$ are approximately equal to $r_{\pi1}$ and $R_C$, respectively. Therefore, the gain expression we actually used for the gain stage is:


$Gain_1 = -g_{m1} \times R_{C1} \times \frac{r_{\pi1}}{R_S+r_{\pi1}}$


\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
      \input{resultsAC1_tab.tex}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Values obtained}
  \label{tab:resultsAC1}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Output stage}
As for the output stage, those same quantities are equal to
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
Gain_2 = \frac{g_{m2}}{g_{m2}+g_{\pi 2}+g_{o2}+g_{e2}} \\ %& \mbox{$(1)$}\\
Z_{I2}= \frac{g_{m2}+g_{\pi 2}+g_{o2}+g_{e2}}{g_{\pi 2} \times (g_{\pi 2}+g_{o2}+g_{e2})} \\ %& \mbox{$(2)$}\\
Z_{O2} = \frac{1}{g_{m2}+g_{\pi 2}+g_{o2}+g_{e2}} \\ %& \mbox{$(3)$}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $g_{m2} = \frac{I_{C2}}{V_T}$, $g_{o2} = \frac{I_{C2}}{V_A}$, $g_{\pi 2} = \frac{g_{m2}}{\beta_{FP}}$ and $g_{e2} = \frac{1}{R_{E2}}$.

% explain why they can be connected without signal loss -----> EXPLAIN!
In the Common Emitter Transistor (Gain Stage), it was necessary to have some form of base biasing for the transistor to operate within the Forward Active Region. The small base bias voltage added to the input signal allowed the transistor to reproduce the full input wave at its output without there being a loss of signal.

The gain stage output impedance and the output stage input impedance are both high, though the latter is an order of magnitude greater than the former, which prevents there being a loss of voltage and therefore allows both stages to be connected without any problem.
