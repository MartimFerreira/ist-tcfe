\label{sec:conclusion}

Overall, the objectives defined for this laboratory were successfully met.

In both the theoretical analysis - in \textit{Octave} - and the simulation - in \textit{ngspice} - the output voltage was very close to $12 \ V$ and had a rather small ripple, which was precisely our aim. The general shape of the graphs obtained in both types of analysis was very similar, with the main difference being the amplitude of the output signals, both of the whole circuit and of the envelope detector portion. This may be due to innaccuracies in the diode model used in theoretical analysis or due to numeric mistakes in the calculation of \textit{$t_{on}$}. This resulted, as was to be expected, in the results obtained in the theoretical part being better (explaining the expected higher merit figure).
