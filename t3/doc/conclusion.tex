\label{sec:conclusion}

Overall, the objectives defined for this laboratory were successfully met.

In both the theoretical analysis in \textit{Octave} and the simulation in \textit{ngspice} the output voltage was very close to $12 \ V$ and had a rather small riplle, which was precisely our aim. As predicted, the results obtained in the theoretical part were better (that is why the merit figure here was also higher).

Unfortunatey, the cost for the circuit was higher than we intended, which also lowers the merit figure.
