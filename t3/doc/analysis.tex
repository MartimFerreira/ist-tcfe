In this part it was crucial to use an adequate theoretical model in order to predict the Envelope Detector and Voltage Regulator circuits. The circuit used here is the same as the one used in \textit{ngspice}. The only difference is that whereas in \textit{ngspice} there was a predefined model for the diodes here we had to choose the model we wanted to used for the diodes (i.e. diode plus a volatge source or resistor). The rest of the circuit was identical.

The plots obtained are the same as in the simulation.

We had to compute the output DC level and the voltage ripple
