\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section, $ngspice$ results for the circuit shown above are presented. Since this laboratory assignment consisted of an optimization problem, to start off we used a more elementary model and after verifying it was working properly, modifications were made in order to improve the quality of the circuit. In this particular case, that meant having the smallest output voltage ripple and the smallest cost possible. Also we wanted to have an output voltage average as close as possible to the $12 V$ we intended.
