The aim of this laboratory assignment is to build an AC-DC converter circuit whose input is AC voltage with frequency $50 \ Hz$ and amplitude $230 \ V$ and whose output is DC voltage $12 \; V$.

The circuit is made up of several parts. In the first one there is a voltage source $v_S$, then there is a transformer with $n$ loops on the left and 1 loop on the right, followed by a full-wave bridge rectifier, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.

The rectifier is composed of 4 diodes ($Dfw1$, $Dfw2$, $Dfw3$ and $Dfw4$). The two other parts were based on the examples explained in the theoretical lectures. The envelope detector has a rectifier with a diode $Ddet$ and a resistor $Rdet$ plus a capacitor $C$ in parallel with the resistor. Finally, there is the voltage regulator with a resistor $Rreg$ and a limiter made up of 4 series in parallel, each with 18 diodes (for a total of 72 diodes). The diodes in parallel help reduce the total resistance in this part of the circuit.

The main objectives were to obtain an average output voltage of $12 \ V$ with a very small ripple while having the cheapest possible circuit.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, there is the theoretical analysis of the circuit (all the necessary calculations were made with \textit{Octave}). In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is simulated with \textit{ngspice}. The theoretical and simulation results are then compared. Lastly,  Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} is the conclusion of the report.
