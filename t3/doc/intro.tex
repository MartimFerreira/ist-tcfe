The aim of this laboratory assignment is to build an AC/Dc converter circuit whose input is AC voltage with frequency $50 \ Hz$ and DC component $230 \ V$ and whose output is DC voltage $12 \ V$.

The circuit is composed up of several parts. In the first one there is a voltage source $V_S$, then there is a transformer with 1 loop on the left and $n$ loops on the right, followed by a full-wave bridge rectifier, composed of 4 diodes ($Dfw1$, $Dfw2$, $Dfw3$ and $Dfw4$). The model chosen for the diodes was the ideal one plus a voltage source $V_{on}$. In \textit{ngspice} it was mandatory to used the default model. The two other parts were based on the examples explained in the theoretical lectures. The envelope detector had a rectifier with a diode $Ddet$ and a resistor $Rdet$ plus a capacitor $C$ in parallel with the resistor. Finally there is the voltage regulator with a resistor $Rreg$ and a limiter made up of 4 series in parallel, each with 18 diodes in total. The diodes were in parallel to reduce the total resistance in this part of the circuit.

Some of the main objectives were to used the lowest possible number of components (namely, resistors, capacitors and diodes) and also obtain an average output voltage of $12 \ V$ with a very small ripple.
