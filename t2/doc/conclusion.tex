\label{sec:conclusion}

On the whole, the objectives set for this laboratory assignment were successfully met, with the results of the theoretical analysis and simulation being consistent and coherent.
In both the simulation and the analysis part, the voltages for all nodes and the currents for all branches were calculated for $t<0$ and for $t=0$. These results matched perfectly, with the only deviations being due to printing rounding errors.
For $t>0$, $V_{6_n}(t)$ and $V_{6_f}(t)$, the natural and forced solutions, were also determined (though the forced solution was only explicitly determined in the theoretical analysis) as well as the total solution for $V_6(t)$. The graphs determined through both methods appeared to be perfectly similar, showing the same overall behaviour and appearing to match point-by-point.
Finally, the frequency responses for the voltages in certain nodes were also computed. Once again, the resulting graphs appear to be extremely similar if not equal (we can't be sure just through a visual analysis, obviously), with, again, the overall shapes and tendencies of the graphs being the same.
