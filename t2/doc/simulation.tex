\subsection{Circuit when $t<0$}

Table \ref{tab:t<0_sim} shows the results of the simulation of the circuit in study for t<0. For this time condition, $v_s = V_s$.

\subsection{Circuit when $t=0$}

Table \ref{tab:t=0_sim} shows the results of the simulation of the circuit in study for t=0. For this simulation, the capacitor was replaced by a voltage source with voltage equal to the difference in electric potential between the terminals of the capacitor for t<0 (that is, $V_6 - V_8$, with $V_6$ and $V_8$ being taken from the previous analysis). This was done because the electric tension between terminals of a capacitor must always be continuous (since a capacitor takes time to charge and discharge), which means the tension between terminals of the capacitor in $t=0$ must be the same it was in our $t<0$ steady-state analysis (even if $V_6$ and $V_8$ had instantaneous variations). The way to ensure this continuity is by doing the aforementioned replacement.

\subsubsection{Natural Solution}

The following graph shows the evolution in time of the natural solution component of the voltage in node 6 according to the simulation that was run. In order to simulate the natural response of the circuit, the voltage source $v_s$ was set to $0$V, and the voltages in nodes 6 and 8 calculated for $t=0$ were used as boundary conditions.

\subsubsection{Final Solution}

The following graph shows the simulated evolution in time of the voltage in node 6 when the voltage source provides a sinusoidal input with frequency $1$kHz. The evolution in time of the voltage source stimulus can also be seen.
