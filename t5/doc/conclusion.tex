\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


Overall, the goals defined for this laboratory were achieved.

We were able to implement a BandPass Filter using a restricted list of components, as well as to modify the circuit in order to have the inteded central frequency $1kHz$ and gain at the central frequency $40 dB$ while having the lowest possible cost.

Overall, the results obtained in the analysis and simulation parts were quite close, though they were slightly better in the former, as expected. In terms of the central frequency and the gain at that same frequency, the values obtained in Octave had deviations of $35.29431 \%$ and $136.1922 \%$. In ngspice, these were $37.32302\%$ and $135.557875 \%$, respectively. With respect to the results from the simulation, the ones in the analysis had a deviation of $3.23677\%$ and $0.26929\%$.

In both cases, one can see that, even though the central frequency is not very close to the one we aimed at, it is still within the passaband range.
