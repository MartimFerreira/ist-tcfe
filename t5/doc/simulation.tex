\section{Simulation Analysis}

In this section, ngspice simulation results for the circuit shown above are presented.


\subsection{Gain Response with Frequency}

An AC analysis of the circuit was performed in order to figure out how the gain of the circuit varied with frequency. The resulting graph can be seen in \ref{fig:gain_freq}.

\end{figure}

This type of analysis allows us to determine the maximum gain of the circuit and its cutoff frequencies, with which we can calculate the central frequency ($f_{central}$) of the passband filter. These values, together with the cost of the circuit, can also be used to calculate the merit figure. In order to perform these measurements, the ngspice functions ``MAX'' and ``WHEN'' were used.

  \caption{Values obtained: $f_{central}$ (centralfreq) is in Hz, the gain at $f = 1 kHz$ (centralgain) is in linear units and the input impedance, which has real and imaginary parts, is in $k\Omega$}

\end{table}

A separate analysis was run, with a different script, in order to determine the circuit's output impedance. In this script, the input voltage source was set to have 0 amplitude and at the end of the circuit a 1V amplitude test voltage source was placed. The output impedance obtained was $Z_o = (0.38 - 14.46j) \Omega$.
