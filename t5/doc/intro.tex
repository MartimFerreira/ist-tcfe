In this laboratory assignment it was our aim to implement a bandpass filter with specific characteristics: a central frequency of 1kHz and a gain at central frequency of 40dB. In order to do that, we had available one 741 OPAMP and a maximum of three of each of the following components: 1k$\Omega$, 10k$\Omega$ and 100k$\Omega$ resistors, and 220nF and 1$\mu$F capacitors. Our objective was also to have the lowest cost and gain and central frequency deviations.

The circuit used was the one in Figure \ref{fig:circuit}.

The ~\ref{sec:analysis} and ~\ref{sec:simulation} sections have the theoretical analysis and the ngspice simulation of the circuit. In ~\ref{sec:conclusion} there is the conclusion of the report.
