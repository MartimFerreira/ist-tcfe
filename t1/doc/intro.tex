The aim of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit composed exclusively by voltage sources ($V_a$ and $V_c$), current sources ($I_b$ and $I_d$), as well as resistors ($R_1$, $R_2$, $R_4$, $R_5$, $R_6$ and $R_7$). That being said, this circuit, which is shown in the image below, contains only linear components.

\par
It was known beforehand that:
$R_1 = 1039.3 \ \Omega$,
$R_2 = 2010.9 \ \Omega$,
$R_3 = 30411.2 \ \Omega$,
$R_4 = 4183.8 \ \Omega$,
$R_5 = 3095.8 \ \Omega$,
$R_6 = 2021.2 \ \Omega$,
$R_7 = 1022.3 \ \Omega$,
$V_a = 5.1798 \ V$,
$I_d = 0.0010044 \ A$,
$K_b = 0.0070875 \ A/V$ and
$K_c = 8185.8 \ V/A$.

\par
Therefore, the objective was to find the values of: $V_0$, $V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$, $V_4$, $V_5$, $V_6$, $V_7$, $I_b$, $I_c$, $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, $V_b$ and $V_c$.

In order to make it easier to analyse the circuit, both meshes and nodes were labelled. $N_0$ was chosen as the ground node, $V_0 = 0 \ V$. $V_i$ is the voltage in node $N_i$ and $I_1$ is the current that goes through mesh $A$ counterclockwise. Likewise, $I_2$ goes through $B$, $I_3$ through $C$ and $I_4$ through $D$, all anticlockwise. Besides that, in each resistance the direction of the current was arbitrarily chosen.

\par
In Section 2, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented following two of the most common methods: the mesh method and the nodal method. In Section 3, the circuit is analysed by simulation and, in Section 4, both types of analysis are compared. Finally, the conclusions of this study are in Section 5.
