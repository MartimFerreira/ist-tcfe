The aim of this laboratory assignment is to study the circuit shown below assuming the lumped-elements approximation. It is composed of voltage sources (an independent one, $V_a$, and a linear current-controlled one, $V_c$), current sources (an independent one, $I_d$, and a linear voltage-controlled one, $I_b$) and resistors ($R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, $R_4$, $R_5$, $R_6$ and $R_7$). All components of this circuit are linear and time-invariant.

The original data that was received had 11 significant digits, however, both Octave and Ngspice software work with an approximation of 5 significant digits, by default. With this new approximation the results still present high precision and the uncertainty range is still bellow 1\%. The table \ref{tab:ap} has all the original values and the values that are considered by the software used.

$N_0$ was chosen as the ground node, $V_0 = 0 \ V$. $V_i$ is the voltage in node $N_i$ ($i=1, 2, ..., 7$) and $I_i$  is the current that goes through mesh $i$ counterclockwise ($i=A, B, C, D$).


\par
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented following the mesh method and the nodal method. In this part, Octave was used to solve all systems of (linear) equations. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed using ngspice. Finally, the comparison between both types of analysis and the conclusions of this study are in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
