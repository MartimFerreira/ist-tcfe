The aim of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit composed exclusively by voltage sources ($V_a$ and $V_c$), current sources ($I_b$ and $I_d$), as well as resistors ($R_1$, $R_2$, $R_4$, $R_5$, $R_6$ and $R_7$). That being said, this circuit, which is shown in the image below, contains only linear components.

It was known beforehand that:
$R_1 = 1039.3 \ \Omega$,
$R_2 = 2010.9 \ \Omega$,
$R_3 = 30411.2 \ \Omega$,
$R_4 = 4183.8 \ \Omega$,
$R_5 = 3095.8 \ \Omega$,
$R_6 = 2021.2 \ \Omega$,
$R_7 = 1022.3 \ \Omega$,
$V_a = 5.1798 \ V$,
$I_d = 0.0010044 \ A$,
$K_b = 0.0070875 \ A/V$ and
$K_c = 8185.8 \ V/A$.


\par
$N_0$ was chosen as the ground node, $V_0 = 0 \ V$. $V_i$ is the voltage in node $N_i$ and $I_i$ ($i=1, 2, ..., 7$) is the current that goes through mesh $i$ counterclockwise ($i=A, B, C, D$).

\par
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented following two of the most common methods: the mesh method and the nodal method (in the former the objective was to find the values of the current in each essential mesh, whereas in the latter it was to find the potential in each node). In this part Octave maths tool was used to solve systems of linear equations to determine the intended variables. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation using Ngspice. Finally, the  comparison between both types of analysis and the conclusions of this study are in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
