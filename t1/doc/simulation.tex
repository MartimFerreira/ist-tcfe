\section{Simulation Analysis}

The aforementioned circuit was simulated using the ngspice simulator, which returned the values in the table below:

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current} and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in Volt.}
  \label{tab:sim}
\end{table}

In the above table, ``@gb[i]'' refers to the current imposed by current source $I_b$ and v(8) refers to the potential in the node 8, an imaginary node that was created when the imaginary 0V voltage source was defined (as explained in the introduction). Because this voltage source has 0V and it was defined as being between node $N_6$ and the imaginary node 8, node 8 is expected to have the same potential as $N_6$, as is the case.
