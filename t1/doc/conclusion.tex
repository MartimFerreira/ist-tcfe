\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\par
In the end, one can say that the objectives defined for this laboratory session were met.
Through the theoretical analysis, all node potentials and mesh currents were determined, with the results proving to be consistent and coherent.
Meanwhile, the circuit simulation returned values for the node potentials and some branch currents, all of which matched those determined previously. This was to be expected as the circuit is very straightforward, being composed entirely of time-invariant linear components.
%As a consequence, the theoretical and the simulation models cannot differ. Were the components a bit more complex, they might have had some differences but that was not the case here.
