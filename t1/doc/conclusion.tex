\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\par
In the end, one can say that the objectives defined for this laboratory session were met. The theoretical analysis, featuring both mesh and nodal methods, in which Octave maths tool was used, had results that proved to be consistent and coherent. As for the circuit simulation part with Ngspice, it was also well succeeded.
\par
The results obtained through both methodologies were the same, as expected, since the circuit is straightforward and composed exclusively by linear components. As a consequence, the theoretical and the simulation models cannot differ. Were the components a bit more complex, they might have had some differences but that was not the case here.
