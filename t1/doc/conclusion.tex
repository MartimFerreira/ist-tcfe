\section{Conclusion}

In the end, one can say that the objectives defined for this laboratory session were met.
Through the theoretical analysis, all node potentials and mesh currents were determined, with the results proving to be consistent and coherent.
Meanwhile, the circuit simulation returned values for the node potentials (and some branch currents) which perfectly matched those determined through nodal analysis. As shown in subsection \ref{sec:comparison}, you can calculate all mesh currents utilizing the node potentials and you'll obtain the same values as the ones obtained through mesh analysis. Thus, we can say that we obtained the same results through the simulation that we did in the theoretical analysis (this was to be expected as the circuit is very straightforward, being composed entirely of time-invariant linear components).
%As a consequence, the theoretical and the simulation models cannot differ. Were the components a bit more complex, they might have had some differences but that was not the case here.
